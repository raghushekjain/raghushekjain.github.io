		<h3 class="what"> What is Camp Enterprise? </h3>

		<p class="talk"> Camp Enterprise was an eye-opening experience that cemented my decision to pursue a post-secondary education in business, specifically in finance. This three-day long excursion taught me invaluable lessons on creating meaningful relationships, executing a sound business plan, and utilizing technical knowledge to develop strong financials. Entrance into the camp was competitive as students must be sponsored by one of the Rotary Clubs across the GTA to attend. After a thorough application process, I was the only student sponsored by the Rotary Club of Bolton from my school.

			<br>

Upon my arrival at camp, I immediately noticed I was a solo traveller whereas others arrived with friends from the same schools. I took this as an opportunity to strengthen my communication skills and create connections with the other 49 students which I was easily able to do, given my outgoing and friendly personality. The camp organizers divided us into six teams and presented us with the challenge: to create a small business plan that would be approved for a loan by industry professionals. Given my highly motivated nature, I was excited to work together with my team and showcase my abilities.

<br>
<br>

Unfortunately, the concept of working together quickly fell apart as there was no apparent leader in the team. Examining the situation, I proposed that everyone introduce themselves and build team rapport which was crucial to the success of our project. From the team building exercises, we noticed that prom was a big topic of discussion; specifically the cost of female dresses. Realizing that prom can be quite an expensive venture for students and their parents, my team founded a dress rental business for all formal occasions. Our business value proposition was to provide cheap rentals on designer dresses so individuals would not have to spend large amounts of money on dresses only worn a few times. This was the foundation for us to develop a strong business plan; reliance on our collective experiences to create something we were passionate about.

<br>
<br>

As an aspiring business student, I took on the role of creating a projected cash flow statement and balance sheet. My team performed financial analysis and created seasonal promotions as we were motivated to come first place. Through this, we estimated our loan to be of approximately $60,000. Our sales pitch quickly piqued the interest of the judges and we were approved for a loan over the asking price for $90,000; a 50% increase and a staggering achievement for my team. This was a testament of the strong teamwork skills and business acumen my team possessed.

<br>
<br>

In the end, my team was ranked first out of the six teams and the judges commended our use of relatable experience to create a unique business proposition. I developed many leadership skills at camp such as communication and teamwork. I improved my technical knowledge of business, accounting and finance. I aspire to continuously further these skills in post secondary to become a well-rounded individual.</p>
