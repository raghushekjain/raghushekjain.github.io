		<h1 class="title"> DECA: Oral Case Competition </h1>
	

		<p class="talk"> In my final year of secondary school, I achieved a long-standing goal of mine which was to be a part of the executive committee for Chinguacousy DECA chapter. My tenure in DECA consists of VP Finance as well as Competitor under the Hospitality and Tourism Team Decision Making Events. I have thrived in these roles by handling over $5000 in chapter funds as well as placing in the 90th percentile across Peel Region to be invited to compete at Provincials this coming February.

As an aspiring business student, I always wanted a role where I would be able to challenge myself to be part of a real-world situation, something that DECA provided me the perfect platform to do so. In my role as VP Finance, I constantly handle, track and record all finances regarding the chapter as well as work with the executive committee to increase our student outreach in school. Having the ability to work well with others on the executive team, advisors and members was essential when it came to sourcing funds for the organization. Furthermore, I implemented a new initiative this year to increase transparency within the organization by creating Financial Statements available for all DECA members to see how their hard-raised money was utilized. This challenging task furthered my understanding of budgeting and financial planning. I am proud for setting a precedent for future executive members to uphold.

My competitive nature excelled under the oral competition aspect of DECA where I participated alongside a partner. As first time DECA competitors, my partner and I worked diligently to prepare for regionals by analyzing sample cases, practicing our presentation skills together and often with other chapter members. We both helped each other improve our communication skills by listening to one another, identifying gaps in our delivery and continuously practicing. In the end, we achieved great success as we placed in the 90th percentile and qualified to compete in DECA Provincials. It was a great sense of personal accomplishment. Furthermore, the number of students competing at the provincial level from our chapter doubled from last time as well; a testament to the leadership efforts of the executive committee.

In February of 2018, I attended DECA Provincials that were being held in Toronto, where I competed amongst almost 8000 students. It was an eye opening and exhilarating experience that changed the way I view the business world. DECA introduced me to the case based study approach through which I was able to further develop my ability to analyze information and present solutions. Knowing that many top business programs in post secondary use a similar approach to education, I highly reccomend that aspiring business students join their high school DECA chapter or take the intiative to create one in their school.</p>
